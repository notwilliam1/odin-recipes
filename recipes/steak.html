        <p>This is a simple recipe for cooking a delicious steak.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 steak (ribeye, sirloin, or your choice)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature (about 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Preheat your skillet or grill to high heat.</li>
            <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil or butter to the skillet. If using garlic and herbs, add them now for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Place the steak in the hot skillet. For a medium-rare steak, cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side. Adjust time for desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Use tongs to flip the steak only once. Avoid pressing down on the steak to keep it juicy.</li>
            <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the skillet and let it rest for about 5 minutes before slicing. This helps retain the juices.</li>
            <li>Slice against the grain and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious steak!</li>
        </ol>
